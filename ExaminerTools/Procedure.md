## Procedure

The experiment aims to investiagte the long-term training and preference effects of using vibrotactile feedback to control a prosthesis. This is done over two sessions a week for a four week period.

| Session<br /> number | ~Length <br /> (min) | Task Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | 60 | - Participant Introduction, Informed Consent form overview, Demographics questionnaire. <br /> - Timed ADL Selection baseline <br /> - Box and Blocks Battery |
| 2 | 30 | - Box and Blocks Battery |
| 3 | 30 | - Box and Blocks Battery |
| 4 | 30 | - Box and Blocks Battery |
| 5 | 30 | - Box and Blocks Battery |
| 6 | 30 | - Box and Blocks Battery |
| 7 | 30 | - Box and Blocks Battery |
| 8 | 60 | - Box and Blocks Battery <br /> - Timed ADL Selection improvement |


#### Participant Introduction 
Participant is given an overview of the research, i.e. why it is being conducted and what we are hoping to learn. 
Provided with all necessary documentation:
- [ ] Participant Information Sheet
- [ ] Informed Consent Form
- [ ] Demographics Questionnaire

#### Informed Consent Forms
Establish whether the participant understands the data that you are collecting, how it is going to be used, and their rights with respect to withdrawal.
Necessary to continue doing the experiment, and provided to participants to sign at every session to keep a record across time.

#### Demographics Questionnaire
Generic Demographics questionnaire to gather categorical information on each participant for analysis later. Only required for the first session.

#### Timed ADL Selection
A selection of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) timed by the experimenter (during operation and taken from Video capture). Tasks adapted from the Southampton Hand Assessment Protocol and the Cybathlon bettery.
Used as a comparative measure of user-skill between the first and last sessions.
